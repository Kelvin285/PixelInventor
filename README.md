<h1><b>PixelInventor</b></h1>
<div/>
  <h2>Project Description</h2>
A Voxel game I created for fun while I was in High-School and while I was in my Freshman year of College.<div/>
The name of the game was originally PixelInventor, but I later changed it to Inignoto.<div/>
  
To run and/or build the game you will need .Net Core 3.1<div/>
The C# Solution file for Visual Studio is located under "PixelInventor/MonoGame/Inignoto.sln"<div/>
The game's executable file is located under "PixelInventor/MonoGame/Inignoto/bin/Release/netcoreapp3.1/Inignoto.exe"<div/>

<h2>Controls</h2>
W = walk forwards<div/>
A = walk left<div/>
S = walk backwards<div/>
D = walk right<div/>
Space = jump<div/>
C = crawl<div/>
Sneak = Left Ctrl<div/>
Run = Left Shift<div/>
Attack = Left-Click<div/>
Use Item = Right-Click<div/>
Scroll through items = Numbers 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,0 or the Mouse Scroll Wheel<div/>
Inventory = Escape<div/>
Switch Perspective = F5<div/>
Chat = Enter<div/>
Reload Assets = F1<div/>

<h2>Extras</h2>
You can also drag the moon around on the title screen by clicking and dragging the mouse.  Releasing the mouse button throws the moon and it bounces around on the screen!<div/>
There is a work-in-progress model editor but it was never finished.  You can access it from the title screen with the "Model Creator" button<div/>

Note: do not turn on Shadows.  The rendering system is unoptimized and shadows will slow down the performance.<div/>
